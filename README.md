# Online Book Store
- This is a flask application that keeps track of books and the authors associated with those books. 
- It also keeps track of the review for each book 
- All the information is stored locally in a SqlLite database in the file publications.db. 
  - You may delete this and make you own by uncommenting the `create_db()` function. 
- _Flask_ was used to make the user interface easy to access, while _Bootstrap_ was used to have a clean layout. 

# Setup
- make sure to have python3 install, with pip 
- use pip to install `flask-sqlalchemy` and `flask`. 
- run `python application.py` to execute the script. 

# TODO 
[ ] Set up Heroku websclient with a Postgres database.
